## Using this image

You can directly reference pre-built versions of `Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp` (latest Debian GA)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:debian` (latest Debian GA)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:debian-12` (or `bookworm`)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:debian-11` (or `bullseye`)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:debian-10` (or `buster`)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:ubuntu` (latest Ubuntu LTS)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:ubuntu-22.04` (or `jammy`)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:ubuntu-20.04` (or `focal`)

Refer to [this guide](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile) for more details.

You can decide how often you want updates by referencing a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of each image. For example:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:1-bookworm`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:1.0-bookworm`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:1.0.0-bookworm`

However, we only do security patching on the latest [non-breaking, in support](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/90) versions of images (e.g. `0-debian-11`). You may want to run `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` in your Dockerfile if you lock to a more specific version to at least pick up OS security updates.

See [history](history) for information on the contents of each version and [here for a complete list of available tags](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/devcontainers/cpp/tags/list).

Alternatively, you can use the contents of `Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

Beyond `git`, this image / `Dockerfile` includes `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, a set of common dependencies for development, and [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) a cross-platform package manager for C++.

### Using Vcpkg
This dev container and its associated image includes a clone of the [`Vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) repo for library packages, and a bootstrapped instance of the [Vcpkg-tool](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool) itself.

The minimum version of `cmake` required to install packages is higher than the version available in the main package repositories for Debian (<=11) and Ubuntu (<=21.10).  `Vcpkg` will download a compatible version of `cmake` for its own use if that is the case (on x86_64 architectures).

Most additional library packages installed using Vcpkg will be downloaded from their [official distribution locations](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#security). To configure Vcpkg in this container to access an alternate registry, more information can be found here: [Registries: Bring your own libraries to vcpkg](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/registries-bring-your-own-libraries-to-vcpkg/).

To update the available library packages, pull the latest from the git repository using the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cd "${VCPKG_ROOT}"
git pull --ff-only
```

> Note: Please review the [Vcpkg license details](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#license) to better understand its own license and additional license information pertaining to library packages and supported ports.
