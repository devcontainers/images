## Using this image

You can also directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:alpine` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.18`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.17`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.16`

Refer to [this guide](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile) for more details.

You can decide how often you want updates by referencing a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of each image. For example:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:0-alpine`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:0.204-alpine`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:0.204.3-alpine`

See [history](history) for information on the contents of each version and [here for a complete list of available tags](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/devcontainers/base/tags/list).

Beyond `git`, this image / `Dockerfile` includes `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development.
