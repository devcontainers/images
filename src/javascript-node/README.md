## Using this image

You can directly reference pre-built versions of `Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:20` (or `20-bookworm`, `20-bullseye`, `20-buster` to pin to an OS version)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:18` (or `18-bookworm`, `18-bullseye`, `18-buster` to pin to an OS version)

Refer to [this guide](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile) for more details.

You can decide how often you want updates by referencing a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of each image. For example:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20` (or `1-20-bookworm`, `1-20-bullseye`, `1-20-buster`)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1.0-20` (or `1.0-20-bookworm`, `1.0-20-bullseye`, `1.0-20-buster`)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1.0.3-20` (or `1.0.3-20-bookworm`, `1.0.3-20-bullseye`, `1.0.3-20-buster`)

However, we only do security patching on the latest [non-breaking, in support](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/90) versions of images (e.g. `1-1.0`). You may want to run `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` in your Dockerfile if you lock to a more specific version to at least pick up OS security updates.

Beyond Node.js and `git`, this image / `Dockerfile` includes `eslint`, `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `node` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development. [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (`nvm`) is also included in case you need to use a different version of Node.js than the one included in the image.
